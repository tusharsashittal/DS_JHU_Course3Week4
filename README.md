Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:

Following are the outputs of this project. They have been uploaded to the gitbub repository whose URL has been submitted as part of the coursera project work.
1. run_analysis.R
2. X_combined_activity.csv
3. X_combined_activity1.csv


run_analysis.R: The R code in this file performs the following requirements of this project:

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

The .R file also has detailed comments for every step/block of code.


X_combined_activity.csv: This is the clean data set that is required in step a - d from above.


X_combined_activity1.csv: This is the clean data set that is required in step e from above.


CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
